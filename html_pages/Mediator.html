          <h4 ><b>DIPLOMATS</b></h4>
<em>Diplomats - Advocates, Mediators, Protagonists, and Campaigners - tend to be warm, caring, and generous individuals, shining in diplomacy and counselling. These personality types promote cooperation and harmony, tolerating discord only as a step towards positive change. Their perceptive abilities seemingly go deeper than the traditional senses - it's as if they have a full set of tuning forks in their hearts that can resonate with people's emotional states, and this empathetic sensitivity creates deep connections with others.</br>

This is not as mystical as it can seem. Diplomat personalities deeply value understanding, and a lifetime of self-reflection grants them insights into others' motivations that they might not even understand themselves. Diplomats can use this to shape the way others feel, but it would be out of character for them to use this for ill.
</br>
Diplomats' people skills nurture friendship and healing with pure, genuine empathy. Causing distress feels to them like wounding their own psyche, so they prefer to gently nudge loved ones and strangers alike in a positive direction. Diplomats find the ideals of humanism rewarding: kindness, understanding, altruism, and growth warm them like a bonfire on a chilly autumn day. These personality types envision a prismatic, kind world.
</br>
The Intuitive trait plays a big part in this optimism, but it also makes Diplomats sensitive to injustices that would jeopardize that ideal world. They can be aggressive against forces they perceive as evil, and are capable of steely action when they feel they have moral high ground. Diplomats' sensitive emotions may flare to outright combativeness if provoked; with self-righteous momentum and weighty ideals, these personality types can steamroll others. If they let inspiration trump rationality unchecked, they can sometimes go too far, damaging the very causes they hold dear, however justified the outrage.
</br>
Tempering this passion with cold practicality is a challenge for Diplomats. They are often reluctant to make and carry out tough decisions or plans lacking in empathy, and often struggle with carrying out a plan at all. They find greater satisfaction in abstract self-exploration and understanding the issues that affect those least able to defend themselves than mundane accomplishments and day-to-day tasks. Diplomats emphasize experience and understanding rather than calculable achievement.
</br>
Among friends and family, Diplomat personalities can range from quietly caring to brightly gregarious, so long as they can pursue the mutual exchange of thoughts and feelings they value so highly. But they can overextend themselves in this more personal aspect of their lives as well - emotionally, physically, or even financially. Diplomats' open hearts make them vulnerable when others aren't as considerate, though they wouldn't have it any other way. Someone must trust first, and they will almost always be the volunteer.
</br>
Diplomats embrace travel as readily as anyone - they like exploring other cultures and people's colorful ways. These personality types are creatively inclined, often practicing artistic expression in diverse forms, and see magical beauty where others see the hum-drum of daily life. For a group with such progressive attitudes, they also appreciate seeing things as they are, a pure expression of a way of thinking and being. Diplomats can be passionately inspired by experiences: music, cuisine, theater, nature, and anything else that goes beyond the obvious can rise to divine art in their eyes.
</br>
Like a gardener planting in fertile earth, Diplomats seed the world around them with progressive change and gentle beauty. Diplomats feel connected to forces they may not fully understand, a deep sense of faith that may express itself, if not always through traditional religion, as spiritual belief. Diplomats pursue things with an underlying idealism and a sense of higher purpose; activism, spirituality, healing, the arts, and charity are common interests for these personalities. They have a conviction to serve a greater good, motivated by intangible rewards felt in the heart and soul.

      It is perhaps more challenging for INFPs to find a satisfying career than any other type. Though intelligent, the regimented learning style of most schools makes long years earning an advanced degree a formidable undertaking for people with the INFP personality type - at the same time, that's often what's needed to advance in a field that rings true for them. INFPs often wish that they could just be, doing what they love without the stress and rigor of professional life.
</br>
Oftentimes, as with so many things, the answer lies somewhere in the middle, in a line of work that begins with passion and dedication, but which comes to require training so that the academia feels intimately linked to that passion. Too many INFPs drift in frustration, ultimately succumbing to the necessities of day-to-day life in a job that wasn't meant for them. But it turns out that, despite such exacting demands, modern economics places a premium on the very keys to INFPs' challenges: their creativity, independence, and need for meaningful relationships with individuals who need their help.</br>
<div class="quotes"><b>

There's Place and Means for Everyone</b></div>
</br>
First and foremost is seemingly every INFPs' dream growing up - to become an author. While a novel is a classic choice, it is rarely an accessible one, and there are many viable options for freedom-loving INFPs. The internet brings to the world the opportunities of blogging and freelance work - as organizations expand their reach beyond their native tongues, they will come to depend on INFP personality types, with their gift for language and written expression, to take their rougher translations and stale pitches and inject them with a sense of beauty and poetry. Smaller organizations will need more than ever to express with elegance the value they bring to local communities.
Most any cause, idea, or field can benefit from the artful and natural expression that INFPs bring to the table, and INFPs have their pick of the world in choosing who they work with.
</br>
The real beauty here is that it takes a core interest that people with the INFP personality type share, while helping a cause they believe in, independently, through creative expression and personal growth, and makes it applicable to any interest there is. There will always be a need, and now more than ever, to win people's hearts and minds with the written word.
</br>
Some INFPs will prefer a still more personal touch, being able to work face-to-face with clients, seeing that their personal effort really impacts another's quality of life. Service careers such as massage therapy, physical rehabilitation, counselling, social work, psychology and even academic roles and retraining can be exceptionally rewarding for INFPs, who take pride in the progress and growth they help to foster. People with the INFP personality type have a tendency to put others' interests ahead of their own, a mixed blessing by itself, but when a patient takes their first unaided step in the long road to recovery after an accident, nothing will feel more rewarding than that selflessness.
<div class="quotes"><b>
</br>If to Do Were as Easy as to Know What Were Good to Do...</b></div></br>

Where INFPs will not thrive is in a high-stress, team-heavy, busy environment that burdens them with bureaucracy and tedium. INFPs need to be able to work with creativity and consideration - high-pressure salespeople they are not. It can be a challenge to avoid these roles, as they are the basis for so much starting work, and it's often a risk to break away into something less dependable, but more rewarding. To find a career that resonates with INFPs' values though, that's more than just a job, sometimes it's just what needs to be done.</em>
