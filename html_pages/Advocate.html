          <h4 ><b>EXPLORER</b></h4>
<em>Explorers - Virtuosos, Adventurers, Entrepreneurs, and Entertainers - possess a self-reliant mix of enthusiasm, quick thinking, and ingenuity that can lead to impressive personal and professional accomplishments. Comfortable with uncertainty and minimally concerned with preparation, these personality types simply adapt and overcome as events present themselves. Explorers' flexibility helps them make snap decisions in the moment, and they're unlikely to dwell on the future or the past.
</br>
They aren't obsessed with precise detail (unless they're really in the zone, in which case they can muster a level of precision and focus that would make a seasoned engineer blush). Usually, they require workability rather than perfection. Explorer personalities are utilitarian masters of diverse tools and techniques, ranging from instruments and engines to the art of persuasion, and they distinguish themselves in crises, crafts, and sales.
</br>
This versatile decisiveness doesn't mean commitment, however. Explorers can change their minds with minimal regret or second-guessing. People in this Role dislike monotony, and often feel tempted to stray from obligations in favor of entertaining new things. They experiment with many interests and live and breathe whatever they connect with - for a time. If these personality types sometimes leave business unfinished, let clutter build up, or misplace important things, it's because they've moved on to something fresh.
</br>
Explorers enjoy being free of obligations, where they can indulge themselves or their interests on their own time. An Explorer might design and build their own dream house, enthralled with the process, but end up procrastinating on simple repairs after a few years. They are highly motivated when steering themselves through something interesting, but don't like being restrained by anything "mandatory."
</br>
Their relaxed, free-form attitude makes Explorer personalities socially dynamic as well. They often seek out people and experiences that cater to their senses, finding more pleasure in stimulation than planning. They happily approach appealing strangers and interesting experiences, and when things get in the way of a good time, they apply their ingenuity to getting around it. Explorers want to see what happens next!
</br>
The same themes run through their friendships and families, though these relationships have much more staying power than most other interests. Rather than forcing relationships into or out of existence though, Explorers let things flow naturally according to their desires. Compatible people simply become a part of their lives. These personality types tend to be individualistic and freedom-loving, going their own way with little regard for naysayers, but they do enjoy knowing that the people they trust will be around in the end.
</br>
Explorers are highly spontaneous, connecting with and adapting to their environment in a way that is almost childlike in its wonder and sheer fun. It can be a challenge for them to work for things with a distant or unexciting payoff, as they need a sense of immediacy to feel truly engaged, but when they are passionate, Explorer personalities can move heaven and earth. </em>

      When it comes to the career world, ISFPs need more than just a job. Wealth, power, structure, advancement and security are all lesser goals to ISFP personalities' greatest need: creative freedom. ISFPs crave a tangible outlet for their imagination, a chance to express themselves artistically.
Those placing their emphasis on predictability and long-term planning find that attempts to push those views on ISFPs are about as effective as forcing open flames to point downwards.
</br>

People with the ISFP personality type are passionate experimenters, and whether they're aware of it or not, they are renowned trendsetters. With their unique perspective and simple desire to be themselves, ISFPs are natural artists, musicians and photographers, as well as designers of all stripes. Setting up shop on websites like Etsy is far more alluring to ISFPs than the confines of 9-5 administrative work in some fluorescent cubicle.

</br>Don't Work at Being Ordinary</b></div></br>

ISFPs loathe sitting idle in colorless, unchanging environments. They are free souls and need flexibility, opportunities for improvisation, and immersive work that engages every sense. If they combine these needs with their competitive nature, ISFP personalities make great solo athletes. ISFPs prefer to live in the moment, believing the here and now is what matters most.
</br>
This quality does have the drawback of sometimes making ISFPs reckless and shortsighted, though those pitfalls aren't set in stone. An emphasis on practical, tangible things, objects that can be seen and touched, comes at the cost of ignoring less tangible ideas. ISFPs often feel that they have little control over processes like retirement planning - they can't predict the future, so it does no good to worry about it now.

</br>Life's too Short for Us to Bore Ourselves</b></div></br>

This mindset can hold them back from many of their ideal careers, such as psychology, counseling and teaching, which require long-term planning and often extensive certifications to get started. It takes a great deal of energy for ISFPs to maintain focus on a single goal like that for so long, but it can make the day-to-day so much more rewarding for the rest of their lives.
</br>
An easier route revolves around freelance and consulting work in just about any industry that ISFPs enjoy. Whether organizing charity events, working with hospitals to make patients' stays more pleasant, or laying stone to help make a house a home, ISFPs always seem to find a way to make the world a little more beautiful and exciting, and to make a living in the process.</em>
