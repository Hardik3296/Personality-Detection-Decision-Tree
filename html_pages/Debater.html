          <h4  ><b>ANALYST</b></h4>
<em>The personality types in the Analyst Role are Architects, Logicians, Commanders, and Debaters. They embrace rationality, excelling in intellectual and technological pursuits. The Thinking trait makes Analysts exacting, and the Intuitive trait lets them apply their minds to almost anything, with their imaginations aiding calculated, strategic thinking, or seeing just how far the rabbit hole goes with a crazy scheme or thought experiment.
These personalities are driven to understand and create, and have no problem switching between speculative musing and frank, solutions-oriented approaches to whatever problems are at hand. Broad, intelligent vision gives Analysts an ingenious air, but they can become overwhelmed and scattered if they do not learn to hone these abilities and use them to advance a worthwhile cause or project.
The biggest pitfall is that their intellect can give them a false sense of accomplishment. They tend to prefer the world of ideas to the sober reality of follow-through, and by assuming the role of critic instead of participant, Analysts sometimes risk being functionally outpaced by those who simply sit down and do the work. They can earn themselves the unsavory title of <i><b>"armchair analysts"</b></i>  while those with more real-world experience continue to create real results. Analyst personality types can lack a proper respect for those of simpler vision and expression, whatever their background, and it can hold them back.
Analysts value their intellect above all else, and it can be a challenge convincing them it's worth checking their many hypotheses with an experiment or proper evidence to be sure. To many Analysts, if something makes sense in their minds, that's as good as proved, and a great deal faster. Analysts can be brilliant, but they're still human; under the influence of ego, these personality types can get in the habit of advancing clever opinions instead of objective facts.
Analysts' positive self-identity stems largely from their formidable drive to learn, and their clever and sharply witty banter can make them excellent debate partners. Often insatiable readers as well, Analysts can be found stockpiling books, questioning teachers, and driving conversations in forums across the world wide web. These types prefer their own processes and pace, and are energized by exercising their minds on their own time.
Analysts are also relentless self-improvers. Once they've recognized a flaw, they apply all of this cold rationality, honest reflection, imagination, and desire for results to make it right. Analysts' forceful, imaginative vision, when trained and focused, enables these personalities to conceive and accomplish things most thought impossible.

     <h4><b>DEBATOR</b></h4>
 <em>In the world of careers, ENTPs have the benefit of being naturally engaged and interested in being productive and helpful. But rather than the sort of people-oriented helpfulness that Diplomats bring to the table, ENTP personalities are focused on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. ENTPs are a versatile personality type, and while it may take time for them to get to a point where they can fully utilize their skillset and qualities, they are likely to find that those qualities translate well into pretty much any career that so much as piques their interest.
If there's anything ENTPs love, it's flexing their mental muscles, and any environment that lets them devise new approaches, new ideas and new projects, that allows them to push the limits of their creativity, will benefit strongly from what ENTPs bring to the table.
</br>
Not every career allows this level of unbridled brainpower, but there are those that demand nothing but: entrepreneurship, engineering, even acting and photography. So long as ENTPs are honest with themselves about their strengths and weaknesses, they can thrive in most any career that is in need of a new line of thinking.
<div class="quotes"><b>

The Value of an Idea Lies in the Using of It</b></div></br>
All this intellectual power can be intimidating, but unlike their Introverted (I) cousins, people with the ENTP personality type have the added benefit of being excellent communicators, in the written word but especially in face-to-face conversation. Though they dislike the constraints of managing others (and of being managed), this social adaptability allows ENTPs to be natural leaders, showing the way forward and inspiring others with sound logic and intellectual prowess. While others may object to these plans with emotional considerations or general resistance to change, things ENTPs place little value in, these competing comments are usually outmaneuvered by ENTP personalities' deft arguments and subtly shifting goals.
</br>
The best careers reward intellectual competency and curiosity, allowing ENTPs to utilize their never-ending flow of ideas productively by affording a degree of spontaneity in how they engage their intellectual pursuits. People with the ENTP personality type value knowledge, rational thought and insight very highly, and they make brilliant lawyers, psychologists, systems analysts and scientists. It's even possible for ENTPs to thrive as sales representatives, as they rationalize purchase decisions that may otherwise seem discretionary - so long as their managers know to give them the space they need to work their magic.
<div class="quotes"><b>
</br>Being Busy Doesn't Always Mean Real Work</b></div></br>
Really it all comes down to a sense of personal freedom, for ENTPs to know that they are allowed to apply themselves fully to understanding and solving the problems that interest them, without getting bogged down by social politics and trying to figure out what makes other people "tick". Routine, structure and formal rules all feel like unnecessary hindrances to ENTPs, and they may find that their best careers yet allow them to engage their intellectual pursuits on their own terms, as freelance consultants or software engineers.
</br>
The key for ENTPs is to have the patience to get to a position that allows for these freedoms, to be in an environment long enough that not just their colleagues, but their managers and, in time, their subordinates, recognize what it is that they bring to the table. ENTPs have exceptional qualities - it's quantifying their achievements and skills that presents the biggest challenge. But once they've got their foot in the door, once they've got a willing ear higher in the hierarchy, the sky's the limit.</em>
