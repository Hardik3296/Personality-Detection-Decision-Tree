          <h4 ><b>DIPLOMATS</b></h4>
<em>Diplomats - Advocates, Mediators, Protagonists, and Campaigners - tend to be warm, caring, and generous individuals, shining in diplomacy and counselling. These personality types promote cooperation and harmony, tolerating discord only as a step towards positive change. Their perceptive abilities seemingly go deeper than the traditional senses - it's as if they have a full set of tuning forks in their hearts that can resonate with people's emotional states, and this empathetic sensitivity creates deep connections with others.</br>

This is not as mystical as it can seem. Diplomat personalities deeply value understanding, and a lifetime of self-reflection grants them insights into others' motivations that they might not even understand themselves. Diplomats can use this to shape the way others feel, but it would be out of character for them to use this for ill.
</br>
Diplomats' people skills nurture friendship and healing with pure, genuine empathy. Causing distress feels to them like wounding their own psyche, so they prefer to gently nudge loved ones and strangers alike in a positive direction. Diplomats find the ideals of humanism rewarding: kindness, understanding, altruism, and growth warm them like a bonfire on a chilly autumn day. These personality types envision a prismatic, kind world.
</br>
The Intuitive trait plays a big part in this optimism, but it also makes Diplomats sensitive to injustices that would jeopardize that ideal world. They can be aggressive against forces they perceive as evil, and are capable of steely action when they feel they have moral high ground. Diplomats' sensitive emotions may flare to outright combativeness if provoked; with self-righteous momentum and weighty ideals, these personality types can steamroll others. If they let inspiration trump rationality unchecked, they can sometimes go too far, damaging the very causes they hold dear, however justified the outrage.
</br>
Tempering this passion with cold practicality is a challenge for Diplomats. They are often reluctant to make and carry out tough decisions or plans lacking in empathy, and often struggle with carrying out a plan at all. They find greater satisfaction in abstract self-exploration and understanding the issues that affect those least able to defend themselves than mundane accomplishments and day-to-day tasks. Diplomats emphasize experience and understanding rather than calculable achievement.
</br>
Among friends and family, Diplomat personalities can range from quietly caring to brightly gregarious, so long as they can pursue the mutual exchange of thoughts and feelings they value so highly. But they can overextend themselves in this more personal aspect of their lives as well - emotionally, physically, or even financially. Diplomats' open hearts make them vulnerable when others aren't as considerate, though they wouldn't have it any other way. Someone must trust first, and they will almost always be the volunteer.
</br>
Diplomats embrace travel as readily as anyone - they like exploring other cultures and people's colorful ways. These personality types are creatively inclined, often practicing artistic expression in diverse forms, and see magical beauty where others see the hum-drum of daily life. For a group with such progressive attitudes, they also appreciate seeing things as they are, a pure expression of a way of thinking and being. Diplomats can be passionately inspired by experiences: music, cuisine, theater, nature, and anything else that goes beyond the obvious can rise to divine art in their eyes.
</br>
Like a gardener planting in fertile earth, Diplomats seed the world around them with progressive change and gentle beauty. Diplomats feel connected to forces they may not fully understand, a deep sense of faith that may express itself, if not always through traditional religion, as spiritual belief. Diplomats pursue things with an underlying idealism and a sense of higher purpose; activism, spirituality, healing, the arts, and charity are common interests for these personalities. They have a conviction to serve a greater good, motivated by intangible rewards felt in the heart and soul.

      "Can't I fly helicopters AND be an oceanographer who writes songs and cooks?" It's a big world out there - perhaps even a little too big. ENFPs are fascinated by new ideas, both in terms of developments in fields they are already familiar with, and when new subjects come along. The trick for people with the ENFP personality type is to take advantage of this quality, this wonder with the magnificent breadth and detail in the world, and to use it to propel themselves further and deeper than others are willing or able to go.
If there's a challenge ENFPs face when selecting a career, it isn't that they lack talent or options or drive, it's that there are so many things out there that are just cool.
<div class="quotes"><b>
</br>ENFP careers
The Opening of a Door Can Be a Wonderfully Joyous Moment</b></div></br>

Chief among ENFPs' talents is their people skills, a quality that is even more valuable now than ever. Even in traditional Analyst strongholds like engineering, systems analysis and the sciences, ENFPs' ability to network and match the communication styles of their audience means that even as they explore new challenges on their own, they will be able to work with others, explore others' perspectives and glean new insights into their projects. Much of modern progress stems from incorporating other studies into typically disassociated fields, and no one is better equipped to merge broad interests than talented, energetic and future-minded ENFPs.</br>

And while Thinking types may be better at applying logic to systems and machines, people with the ENFP personality type are able to apply that same logic to human interactions and networks, using their exceptional social perception to find out what makes people tick. This lends ENFPs a solid foothold in any human science or service, from psychology, counseling and teaching to politics, diplomacy and detective work. All of these fields have another important similarity: they are in constant development, shifting, presenting new angles and new approaches. It's simply not possible to be good in these fields and content with the way things are, and this is where ENFPs truly shine.
<div class="quotes"><b>
</br>Too Many Bosses, Too Few Workers</b></div></br>

Where ENFPs do not shine is in systems of strict regimentation and hierarchy, such as military service. ENFPs thrive on the ability to question the status quo and explore the alternatives, and if this is a quality that is not just unappreciated but actually frowned upon, this will not only make them unhappy, but it may even threaten their emotional stability. Repetition, predictability, boredom... while some Sentinel types may appreciate predictability and clear hierarchies, these are not selling points for ENFPs. People with the ENFP personality type need to feel like they're pushing boundaries and exploring ideas, and should focus on interests and careers that encourage that.
</br>
Many more career options satisfy these needs, and not just the scientific ones - writing, journalism, acting and TV reporting all give ENFPs a chance to explore something new every day and stir the pot a little while they're at it. It may come to pass though, that the best way forward for ENFP personalities is to establish themselves as entrepreneurs and consultants, blazing their own trails and taking on whatever project is most fascinating. So long as they get to use their people skills, identify and achieve their own goals and inspire their colleagues and followers, ENFPs will be happy.</em>
