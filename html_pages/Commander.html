          <h4  ><b>ANALYST</b></h4>
<em>The personality types in the Analyst Role are Architects, Logicians, Commanders, and Debaters. They embrace rationality, excelling in intellectual and technological pursuits. The Thinking trait makes Analysts exacting, and the Intuitive trait lets them apply their minds to almost anything, with their imaginations aiding calculated, strategic thinking, or seeing just how far the rabbit hole goes with a crazy scheme or thought experiment.
These personalities are driven to understand and create, and have no problem switching between speculative musing and frank, solutions-oriented approaches to whatever problems are at hand. Broad, intelligent vision gives Analysts an ingenious air, but they can become overwhelmed and scattered if they do not learn to hone these abilities and use them to advance a worthwhile cause or project.
The biggest pitfall is that their intellect can give them a false sense of accomplishment. They tend to prefer the world of ideas to the sober reality of follow-through, and by assuming the role of critic instead of participant, Analysts sometimes risk being functionally outpaced by those who simply sit down and do the work. They can earn themselves the unsavory title of <i><b>"armchair analysts"</b></i>  while those with more real-world experience continue to create real results. Analyst personality types can lack a proper respect for those of simpler vision and expression, whatever their background, and it can hold them back.
Analysts value their intellect above all else, and it can be a challenge convincing them it's worth checking their many hypotheses with an experiment or proper evidence to be sure. To many Analysts, if something makes sense in their minds, that's as good as proved, and a great deal faster. Analysts can be brilliant, but they're still human; under the influence of ego, these personality types can get in the habit of advancing clever opinions instead of objective facts.
Analysts' positive self-identity stems largely from their formidable drive to learn, and their clever and sharply witty banter can make them excellent debate partners. Often insatiable readers as well, Analysts can be found stockpiling books, questioning teachers, and driving conversations in forums across the world wide web. These types prefer their own processes and pace, and are energized by exercising their minds on their own time.
Analysts are also relentless self-improvers. Once they've recognized a flaw, they apply all of this cold rationality, honest reflection, imagination, and desire for results to make it right. Analysts' forceful, imaginative vision, when trained and focused, enables these personalities to conceive and accomplish things most thought impossible.

      It is in the world of careers that ENTJs' boldness and drive are truly at their best. No other personality type is better suited than ENTJs to be the respected leader of an organization or team, and no other personality type enjoys it quite so much. Combining their vision, intelligence and determination to push ideas through to completion no matter the obstacles, ENTJs are a force to be reckoned with.
ENTJ careers<div class="quotes"><b>
</br>We All Go Up, or We All Go Down</b></div></br>
In the world of business, the sometimes overbearing level of self-confidence that ENTJs (especially Assertive ones) too often mishandle in their personal relationships is transformed into an admirable authority, keeping people on track and getting things done. Naturally the best careers for people with the ENTJ personality type make the fullest use of these qualities, and many would describe executive positions and entrepreneurialism to be ideal lines of work - any position high enough that they can clearly see the horizon.
</br>
For ENTJs, failure is not an option - they conceive a vision of the future, formulate a strategy to achieve that vision, and execute each step with ruthless precision.
</br>
Structure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy, or holds things back with incompetence, laziness or inefficiency, ENTJs will not hesitate to come down, hard. ENTJ personalities pursue their goals with singular vision, and have strict standards for themselves and others that are designed above all else to be effective. This makes ENTJs excellent corporate strategists, and their objectivity and clarity of thought make them respected lawyers and judges.
</br>
None of this could work if no one could understand what ENTJs were thinking, and they have the good fortune of being clear and concise communicators, especially in person, making business administration a comfortable fit - so long as their tasks don't stray too far into routine maintenance and upkeep. ENTJs also have a thirst for knowledge, and they aren't afraid to use a principle once they've grasped its underlying mechanisms. Combining this with their leadership makes ENTJs trying, but effective, university professors.</br>
<div class="quotes"><b>
</br>We Are Still in the Making</b></div></br>
The only problem is, it takes time for ENTJs' skills to be recognized, and stagnating as low-level employees will have them bouncing off the walls and deeply unhappy. People with the ENTJ personality type crave leadership and responsibility, growth and opportunity, and genuinely enjoy managing others to get a job done. ENTJs are visionaries and leaders, not grunts or day-to-day administrators. Getting that to be recognized is not always easy, but ENTJs are probably up to the task.</em>
