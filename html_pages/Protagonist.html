          <h4 ><b>DIPLOMATS</b></h4>
<em>Diplomats - Advocates, Mediators, Protagonists, and Campaigners - tend to be warm, caring, and generous individuals, shining in diplomacy and counselling. These personality types promote cooperation and harmony, tolerating discord only as a step towards positive change. Their perceptive abilities seemingly go deeper than the traditional senses - it's as if they have a full set of tuning forks in their hearts that can resonate with people's emotional states, and this empathetic sensitivity creates deep connections with others.</br>

This is not as mystical as it can seem. Diplomat personalities deeply value understanding, and a lifetime of self-reflection grants them insights into others' motivations that they might not even understand themselves. Diplomats can use this to shape the way others feel, but it would be out of character for them to use this for ill.
</br>
Diplomats' people skills nurture friendship and healing with pure, genuine empathy. Causing distress feels to them like wounding their own psyche, so they prefer to gently nudge loved ones and strangers alike in a positive direction. Diplomats find the ideals of humanism rewarding: kindness, understanding, altruism, and growth warm them like a bonfire on a chilly autumn day. These personality types envision a prismatic, kind world.
</br>
The Intuitive trait plays a big part in this optimism, but it also makes Diplomats sensitive to injustices that would jeopardize that ideal world. They can be aggressive against forces they perceive as evil, and are capable of steely action when they feel they have moral high ground. Diplomats' sensitive emotions may flare to outright combativeness if provoked; with self-righteous momentum and weighty ideals, these personality types can steamroll others. If they let inspiration trump rationality unchecked, they can sometimes go too far, damaging the very causes they hold dear, however justified the outrage.
</br>
Tempering this passion with cold practicality is a challenge for Diplomats. They are often reluctant to make and carry out tough decisions or plans lacking in empathy, and often struggle with carrying out a plan at all. They find greater satisfaction in abstract self-exploration and understanding the issues that affect those least able to defend themselves than mundane accomplishments and day-to-day tasks. Diplomats emphasize experience and understanding rather than calculable achievement.
</br>
Among friends and family, Diplomat personalities can range from quietly caring to brightly gregarious, so long as they can pursue the mutual exchange of thoughts and feelings they value so highly. But they can overextend themselves in this more personal aspect of their lives as well - emotionally, physically, or even financially. Diplomats' open hearts make them vulnerable when others aren't as considerate, though they wouldn't have it any other way. Someone must trust first, and they will almost always be the volunteer.
</br>
Diplomats embrace travel as readily as anyone - they like exploring other cultures and people's colorful ways. These personality types are creatively inclined, often practicing artistic expression in diverse forms, and see magical beauty where others see the hum-drum of daily life. For a group with such progressive attitudes, they also appreciate seeing things as they are, a pure expression of a way of thinking and being. Diplomats can be passionately inspired by experiences: music, cuisine, theater, nature, and anything else that goes beyond the obvious can rise to divine art in their eyes.
</br>
Like a gardener planting in fertile earth, Diplomats seed the world around them with progressive change and gentle beauty. Diplomats feel connected to forces they may not fully understand, a deep sense of faith that may express itself, if not always through traditional religion, as spiritual belief. Diplomats pursue things with an underlying idealism and a sense of higher purpose; activism, spirituality, healing, the arts, and charity are common interests for these personalities. They have a conviction to serve a greater good, motivated by intangible rewards felt in the heart and soul.

     <h4><b>PROTAGONIST</b></h4>
 <em>
      When it comes to finding a career, people with the ENFJ personality type cast their eyes towards anything that lets them do what they love most - helping other people! Lucky for them, people like being helped, and are even willing to pay for it, which means that ENFJs are rarely wanting for inspiration and opportunity in their search for meaningful work.
      <div class="quotes"><b>
      </br>ENFJ careers
Don't Worry When You Are Not Recognized, but Strive to Be Worthy of Recognition</b></div></br>

ENFJs take a genuine interest in other people, approaching them with warm sociability and a helpful earnestness that rarely goes unnoticed. Altruistic careers like social and religious work, teaching, counseling, and advising of all sorts are popular avenues, giving people with the ENFJ personality type a chance to help others learn, grow, and become more independent. This attitude, alongside their social skills, emotional intelligence and tendency to be "that person who knows everybody", can be adapted to quite a range of other careers as well, making ENFJs natural HR administrators, event coordinators, and politicians - anything that helps a community or organization to operate more smoothly.
</br>
To top it all off, ENFJs are able to express themselves both creatively and honestly, allowing them to approach positions as sales representatives and advertising consultants from a certain idealistic perspective, intuitively picking up on the needs and wants of their customers, and working to make them happier. However, ENFJs need to make sure they get to focus on people, not systems and spreadsheets, and they are unlikely to have the stomach for making the sort of decisions required in corporate governance positions - they will feel haunted, knowing that their decision cost someone their job, or that their product cost someone their life.
</br>
Having a preference for Intuition (N) over Observation (S) also means that careers demanding exceptional situational awareness, such as law enforcement, military service, and emergency response, will cause ENFJs to burn out quickly. While great at organizing willing parties and winning over skeptics, in dangerous situations ENFJs just won't be able to maintain the sort of focus on their immediate physical surroundings that they inevitably demand of themselves hour after hour, day after day.
<div class="quotes"><b>
</br>Always Bear in Mind That Your Own Resolution to Succeed Is More Important Than Any Other</b></div></br>
It makes a great deal more sense for ENFJs to be the force keeping these vital services organized and running well, taking their long-term views, people skills and idealism, and using them to shape the situation on the ground, while more physical personality types manage the moment-to-moment crises. People with the ENFJ personality type are always up for a good challenge - and nothing thrills them quite like helping others. But while willing to train the necessary skills, ENFJs will always show an underlying preference for the sort of help that draws a positive long-term trend, that effects change that really sticks.
</br>
At the heart of it, ENFJs need to see how the story ends, to feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of the people they've helped in order to be happy.
</br>
Careers operating behind enemy lines and arriving at the scene of the crime too late to help will simply weigh on ENFJs' sensitive hearts and minds, especially if criticized despite their efforts. On the other hand, ENFJs are a driven, versatile group, and that same vision that pulls them towards administration and politics can help them focus through the stress of the moment, knowing that each second of effort contributes to something bigger than themselves.</em>
